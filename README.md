# HeavyTrafficIndicators

In this project, we have identified and provided heavy traffic indicators based on the westbound traffic volume data of Interstate Highway I-94. Through time series analysis, we have determined specific time periods to avoid heavy traffic. Furthermore, we have analyzed the weather data and found that it has a lesser impact on the traffic volume of I-94.

For more detailed information, please refer to the HeavyTrafficIndicators.ipynb file.
